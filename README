Library of C++ wrappers for low-level system functions.

Following headers put declarations into the 'sys' namespace:

sysstring.h	Forward declaration of 'string' class (either std::string or
		ext::string).  Multibyte/wide string conversions.
sysstring.cc
syserror.h	System error exception classes.
syserror.cc
sysenv.h	System environment manipulation.
sysfs.h		Filesystem manipulation.
sysfs.cc
syshandle.h	Generic class that wraps access to system 'handle' objects.
sysio.h		Wrappers for low level system I/O.
sysio.cc
sysdll.h	Interface for dynamic-loading libraries.
sysatomic.h	Atomic exchange/add inline functions.
sysmemmap.h	Interface for memory mapped files.
sysmmdetail.h
sysmemmap.cc
membuf.hpp	C++ streams interface to memory mapped I/O.
membuf.cc
fstream.hpp	C++ streams interface to low level system I/O.
fstream.cc

Following headers are Windows-only (still using 'sys' namespace):

winmem.hpp	Windows memory management (GlobalAlloc and friends).
clipboard.hpp	Windows clipboard access interface.
registry.hpp	Windows registry access interface.
registry.tcc
timer.hpp	High-performance system timer (non-win32 version uses
timer.cc	boost::timer instead).

Following headers put declarations into the 'bin' namespace:

bindata.h	byte-swapping inline functions for endianness handling.
binio.h		inline functions for binary I/O.

Following header puts declarations into the 'icase' namespace:

icase.h		case insensitive string comparison functors.

Following headers put declarations into global namespace:

refcount_ptr.h	reference counting pointer implementation.
lstring.h	light_string and short_string -- light-weight string classes.

Sys++ wrappers use the following boost libraries and headers:

cstdint.hpp		for intXX_t platform-independent types.
static_assert.hpp	for compile-time assertions.
scoped_array.hpp	for dynamically allocated buffers.
operators.hpp		for overloaded operators.
